#Paper Hero Game
This game system was originally prototyped for a Day-Of-Code event. It allows visitors to draw a game character on paper, then scan it into the system. They are given a code to enter on their phone which becomes a controller to play in a multiplayer game using their designed character. 

See `paper-art-eater' for more instructions.
